Social Determinants of Substance Misuse – Data Science Project

📊 Project Overview

The "Social Determinants of Substance Misuse" project is a comprehensive data science initiative aimed at identifying the socio-economic determinants of substance misuse in England. This project leverages publicly available datasets from Public Health England (PHE), Office for National Statistics (ONS), and NHS Digital to explore how income, education, employment, and housing factors contribute to substance misuse rates across different regions. The objective is to develop actionable insights through data analysis, predictive modelling, and interactive visualisations that can inform public health strategies and targeted interventions.
The "Social Determinants of Substance Misuse" project explores the socio-economic factors that contribute to substance misuse in England, focusing on income, education, employment, and housing metrics. This project aims to provide actionable insights by analysing datasets sourced from Public Health England (PHE), the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and NHS Digital. By employing data engineering, visualisation, and predictive analytics techniques, the project identifies high-risk regions and vulnerable populations to inform targeted interventions and policy-making.
The "Social Determinants of Substance Misuse" project is a comprehensive data science initiative that examines the socio-economic factors contributing to substance misuse in England. By analysing datasets from Public Health England (PHE), Office for National Statistics (ONS), and NHS Digital, the project seeks to identify key indicators that influence substance misuse rates, such as income levels, education, employment, and housing stability. The project leverages data science techniques, including data processing, predictive modelling, and visualisation, to uncover patterns that can inform public health policies and intervention strategies. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers and public health officials to allocate resources effectively and implement targeted interventions in high-risk regions.

The project employs a no-code/low-code approach using Power BI, KNIME, and Excel to ensure accessibility while maintaining analytical rigour. Predictive models, including linear regression and K-Means clustering, are used to identify high-risk zones based on socio-economic data, enabling targeted intervention strategies. Visualisations, such as correlation matrices and cluster analysis, provide a comprehensive view of the data, highlighting regions with elevated substance misuse rates and the socio-economic factors driving these trends.

📈 Key Insights & Findings

Income and Employment: Regions with higher poverty and unemployment rates exhibit significantly higher substance misuse rates, underscoring the socio-economic impact on substance misuse.

Education: Educational attainment is inversely related to substance misuse, indicating that educational interventions could mitigate risk.

Predictive Models: The predictive models, including K-Means clustering, effectively identify high-risk zones, categorising regions into low, medium, and high-risk clusters based on socio-economic variables.

Data Visualisation: Interactive visualisations, including correlation matrices and regional heatmaps, provide a comprehensive view of socio-economic factors and their impact on substance misuse, enabling stakeholders to identify key risk factors and prioritise intervention efforts.

Regions with higher poverty and unemployment rates exhibit significantly higher substance misuse rates, emphasising the socio-economic impact on substance misuse.

Educational attainment is inversely related to substance misuse rates, indicating the protective effect of higher education levels.

Predictive models effectively identify high-risk zones using K-Means clustering, categorising regions into low, medium, and high-risk clusters based on socio-economic variables.

Visualisations, including correlation matrices and regional heatmaps, provide a comprehensive view of socio-economic factors and their impact on substance misuse.

Income and Employment: Regions with higher poverty and unemployment rates exhibit significantly higher substance misuse rates, aligning with socio-economic theories on financial instability and substance misuse.

Education: Educational attainment shows a strong negative correlation with substance misuse prevalence, suggesting that targeted educational interventions could mitigate risk.

Predictive Models: The predictive models effectively identified high-risk areas using socio-economic indicators, categorising regions into low, medium, and high-risk zones. This clustering approach aids in prioritising resource allocation and intervention efforts.

📊 Substance Misuse by Region
